[ Proposed JSON DNS HTTP API format ]

(IP address or hostname of "server")(:port)/(optional prefix)/(QCLASS)/(QNAME)/(QTYPE)

Example:

[ Proposed JSON DNS envelope format ]

Below is the proposed envelope format for JSON DNS messages - it's pretty much a straight mapping from the binary format. I'm sure there is a better way to represent this ...

<MESSAGE>
-------
{
"header":{
  "ID":"", # 16 bit ID
  "QR":"", # boolean
  "Opcode":"", # 0-15 (QUERY, IQUERY (obsolete), STATUS)
  "AA":"", # boolean
  "TC":"", # boolean
  "RD":"", # boolean
  "RA":"", # boolean
  "RCODE":"", # 0-15 (no_error, format_error, server_failure, name_error, not_implemented, refused)
  "QDCOUNT":"", # unsigned 16 bit integer - optional for HTTP? leave out by default?
  "ANCOUNT":"", # unsigned 16 bit integer - optional for HTTP? leave out by default?
  "NSCOUNT":"", # unsigned 16 bit integer - optional for HTTP? leave out by default?
  "ARCOUNT":"" # unsigned 16 bit integer - optional for HTTP? leave out by default?
},
"question":[
  {
    "QNAME":"", # domain name
    "QTYPE":"", # two octet code
    "QCLASS":"", # two octet code
 } #, [...]
],
"answer":[
  { <RDATA> } #, [...]
],
"authority":[
  { <RDATA> } #, [...]

"additional":[
  { <RDATA> } #, [...]
]
}

<RDATA>
-----

{
  "NAME":"", # domain name
  "TYPE":"", # two octet code
  "CLASS":"",  # two octet code
  "TTL":"", # 32 bit unsigned integer
  "RDLENGTH":"", # 16 bit unsigned integer - optional for HTTP? leave out by default?
  "RDATA":"", # variable length
}


[ Proposed mapping of HTTP Status Codes to DNS RCODEs ]

Below is a proposed mapping of HTTP Status Codes to DNS RCODES, the intention of this is to allow for existing web servers to serve static files and act as JSON DNS servers with little or no modification. 

RFC 1035 4.1.1.          = HTTP Status Code
-------------------------------------------
RCODE 0 No Error, AA on  = 200 OK
RCODE 0 No Error, AA off = 203 Non-Authoritative Information
RCODE 1 Format error     = 400 Bad Request
RCODE 2 Server Failure   = 503 Service Unavailable
RCODE 3 Name Error	 = 404 Not Found
RCODE 4 Not Implemented  = 501 Not Implemented
RCODE 5 Refused	         = 403 Forbidden

RFC 1035: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035
HTTP Status Codes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

"A JSON DNS Client MUST assume that recursion IS NOT available unless the HTTP Header "X-DNS-Recursion: available" is present in the request."
"A JSON DNS Server MUST assume that recursion IS desired unless the HTTP Header "X-DNS-Recursion: not-desired" is present in the request."


[ Proposed method for servers to advertise JSON DNS capability ]

Below is the proposed method of announcing that a server is capable of answering JSON DNS queries. The server could be a web application, or just a webserver serving static files. The SRV allows for pointing at HTTP servers running on non-standard ports. The TXT record allows for custom paths.

"A JSON DNS server MUST announce the ability to answer queries via HTTP using a SRV record in the Authority section an A record where the rdata contains the IP address to the server and a TXT record where the rdata contains the string "path=" followed by the base path to be used by JSON DNS clients when constructing queries."

Example:

$ dig @4.2.2.2 +norecurse domdori.com

; <<>> DiG 9.4.3-P3 <<>> @4.2.2.2 +norecurse domdori.com
; (1 server found)
